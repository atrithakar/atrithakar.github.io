                    for creativity and innovation.</li>
                <li class="list">I am a Programmer, AI/ML Enthusiast and Web Developer. I like to code and I am a good
                    learner</li>

                <li class="list">I believe in the power of design, the magic of coding, and the art of storytelling. My
                    journey in the world of coding has been a thrilling adventure where every project is a canvas, and
                    every line of code is a stroke of my digital brush.</li>

                <li class="list">My mission is to craft digital experiences that not only captivate the eye but also
                    touch the heart. I thrive on turning complex ideas into elegant and user-friendly solutions. With a
                    keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I ensure that every project I undertake
                    is a masterpiece in its own right.</li>

                <li class="list">When I'm not immersed in pixels and code, you can find me exploring the world, seeking
                    inspiration in nature, or sipping on a good cup of coffee. I firmly believe that life experiences
                    fuel creativity, and I draw from my adventures to infuse a unique perspective into my work.</li>

                <li class="list">I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals
                    who share my passion for innovation and design. If you have a project in mind or simply want to
                    connect, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something remarkable together.</li>
